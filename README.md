# bridge-solver

A fast double-dummy solver for bridge, with par-contract scoring and
card-by-card play analysis. Native binaries for macOS, Windows and Linux, a
WebAssembly build for the browser, and a Rust crate to build against.

## What it does

- **A single deal** — `solver-diag` takes one deal and prints the full table of
  twenty results, four declarers by five strains.
- **A file of deals** — `bridge-solver` annotates PBN files in place with
  `DoubleDummyTricks`, `OptimumResultTable`, `OptimumScore` and `ParContract`,
  in the tags Bridge Composer reads.
- **A collection of deals** — point it at a directory and it walks the tree.
  Boards that already carry analysis are passed through byte-for-byte, so
  running it over a library only fills in what is missing.
- **Card by card** — not just how many tricks the deal is worth, but what each
  card played costs against best defence, and what the alternatives were. In the
  crate and in the browser build.
- **Par scoring** — the optimum score and the contracts that achieve it, given
  vulnerability: every contract tied at par, and named for a single seat when
  only one partner can take the tricks, the way Bridge Composer writes them.

Files and collections are **multithreaded**, and there is nothing to switch on:
work is spread over every core by default, and `--threads` is there to turn it
down. The unit scheduled is a (deal, strain) pair rather than a whole deal,
which is what keeps the last threads busy rather than waiting on the slowest
deal. **The output is identical at any thread count** — tables are assembled by
index, not in completion order.

## Performance

A full twenty-cell table costs **about 14 ms** for a typical deal on an M4 Pro
— that is across its twelve cores, which is how you would actually run it, and
about 110 ms if you pin it to one. Deal cost varies about tenfold: over a
ten-board sample the single-core range was 15 ms to 263 ms.

On the same machine 200 boards take **2.75 s** on twelve threads against 22.6 s
on one, an **8.2x** speedup. Scaling is near-linear to eight — this M4 Pro has
eight performance cores — and climbs more slowly as the four efficiency cores
join. The [command-line guide](docs/cli-guide.md#threading) has the full sweep.

Freak deals are the exception worth knowing about: several voids and a deep
search can run for **tens of seconds** — 39.7 s and 1.6 GB for the worst in our
corpus. Rare enough not to move a batch's total, but it will be the deal you
wait on.

For context, over the reference's own 200-deal corpus this port runs at 1.067x
the C++ reference's time and 1.14x DDS 2.9's, searching a tree identical to the
reference's node for node.
[`bench/results/release-profile.md`](bench/results/release-profile.md) is the
full record — how all three were measured together, what was tried, and what was
found to be worthless.

## Install

Download the archive for your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/bridge-craftwork/bridge-solver/releases); each
holds both binaries and the licences.

| Archive | Platform |
|---|---|
| `bridge-solver-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` | macOS, Apple Silicon |
| `bridge-solver-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` | macOS, Intel |
| `bridge-solver-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | Linux, x86-64 |
| `bridge-solver-windows-x86_64.zip` | Windows, x86-64 |
| `bridge-solver-wasm.tar.gz` | WebAssembly package, for browsers and Node |

```sh
bridge-solver -i deals.pbn                 # analyse one file, to stdout
bridge-solver -w -i deals.pbn              # ...or rewrite it in place
bridge-solver -w -i Curated/               # annotate a whole tree
bridge-solver -w -i Curated/ -j 4          # ...on four threads
solver-diag  -f deal.txt                   # one deal, full table
```

Every switch, both file formats and the things the annotator will not touch are
in the **[command-line guide](docs/cli-guide.md)**.

## In the browser

The [demonstration site](https://bridge-craftwork.github.io/bridge-solver/) runs
the same engine compiled to WebAssembly — nothing is sent to a server. Paste a
deal or a LIN file and it will give you the double-dummy table and walk the play
card by card, marking what each one cost. There is also a
[gallery](https://bridge-craftwork.github.io/bridge-solver/gallery.html) of
worked examples.

In wasm a twenty-cell table is ~250 ms and a full per-card analysis of a
complete deal ~128 ms, against ~90 ms for the same analysis natively.

## As a Rust crate

Not yet on crates.io — it depends on `bridge-types` by git, which crates.io does
not allow — so take it from git:

```toml
[dependencies]
bridge-solver = { git = "https://github.com/bridge-craftwork/bridge-solver" }
```

```rust
use bridge_solver::{Hands, Solver, CutoffCache, PatternCache, NOTRUMP, WEST};
use bridge_types::Deal;

let deal = Deal::from_pbn("N:AKQT3.J6.KJ42.95 652.AK42.AQ87.T4 J74.QT95.T.AK863 98.873.9653.QJ72").unwrap();
let hands = Hands::from_deal(&deal);

let mut cutoff = CutoffCache::new(16);
let mut pattern = PatternCache::new(16);
let solver = Solver::new(hands, NOTRUMP, WEST);
let ns_tricks = solver.solve_with_caches(&mut cutoff, &mut pattern);
```

The solver holds no global state and is safe to drive from many threads at once;
give each its own pair of caches. Optional features: `play-analysis` for
card-by-card analysis, `cli` for the binaries.
