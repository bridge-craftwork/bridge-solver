//! bridge-solver - Double-dummy solver for PBN files
//!
//! Reads a PBN file containing bridge deals, performs double-dummy analysis,
//! and writes the results as Bridge Composer compatible tags, where Bridge
//! Composer itself puts them (see `fixtures/bridge-composer`):
//! - DoubleDummyTricks (compact encoding)
//! - OptimumScore (if vulnerability is known)
//! - ParContract (if vulnerability is known)
//!
//! all three one-line supplemental tag pairs, sorted alphabetically among the
//! board's other supplemental tags; and
//! - OptimumResultTable (full table)
//!
//! a supplemental *section*, below `[Auction]` and `[Play]` and sorted
//! alphabetically among any other sections.
//!
//! Boards whose deal is incomplete are passed through untouched.
//!
//! How a PBN file is shaped is `bridge_encodings::pbn::PbnDocument`'s: it holds
//! the file as written and splices the tags in, so `%` directives, `;` comments
//! and `{...}` commentary survive byte-for-byte, CRLF stays CRLF, a file that
//! ended without a newline still does, and a file with nothing to add is not
//! rewritten at all. What is this binary's is which tags to write and which
//! boards to write them on.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   bridge-solver -i <file.pbn> -o <file.pbn>   # one file to another
//!   bridge-solver -i <file.pbn>                 # one file to stdout
//!   bridge-solver -w -i <file.pbn> <dir> ...    # annotate in place, recursively
