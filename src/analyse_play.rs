//! Double-dummy cardplay analysis: which played cards cost tricks, and what
//! the alternatives were worth.
//!
//! Consumed by the HTTP service (`POST /dd/play`, `POST /dd/play/node`), by the
//! WebAssembly build that runs the same analysis in a browser, and by anything
//! else linking this crate. Kept free of I/O, threads and clocks so all three
//! get identical answers.
//!
//! Two tiers, because detecting errors does not require enumerating alternatives:
//!
//! **Tier 1 — running trace ([`running_trace`], `/dd/play`).** Let `V_k` be the
//! declaring-side double-dummy tricks of the position **before** the k-th card
//! (tricks already won by the declaring side + optimal remaining, both sides DD).
//! Solve `V_0..V_M`. Under optimal play `V` is flat; the card that moves
//! `V_k -> V_{k+1}`, attributed to the seat that played it, **is** its cost:
//! - declarer/dummy: `cost = max(0, V_k - V_{k+1})`
//! - defender:       `cost = max(0, V_{k+1} - V_k)`
//!
//! So each played card's cost falls out of one position solve — no alternatives
//! needed for the badge. **Forced-follow nodes** (one legal card) can't change the
//! value, so `V` carries over and we skip the solve. `V_0` = the contract's DD
//! result (`contract_tricks`).
//!
//! **Tier 2 — alternatives ([`node_alternatives`], `/dd/play/node`).** For one
//! node, enumerate the legal cards, collapse touching-rank equivalents, solve the
//! position after each -> declaring-side total `W_c`, and `cost(c) = |W_c - V_node|`
//! (`V_node` is the double-dummy value = the best `W_c` for the side on lead).
//!
//! Everything is framed as **declaring-side whole-deal tricks** so declarer and
//! defender errors are comparable and `cost` reads as "tricks this player's side
//! gave away". The solver returns **NS** tricks; we convert with `is_ns(declarer)`
//! and the full-deal total: `declaring = ns` if the declaring side is NS, else
//! `total - ns`.
//!
//! ## Caching (per play PREFIX)
//! Position values are keyed on `hash(deal + trump + leader + plays[0..k])`
//! ([`prefix_keys`]) — the NS value of a position is declarer-independent, so the
//! key omits the declarer and the cost direction is applied at read time. This
//! makes an incremental caller (growing prefixes) solve only each newly reached
//! position; the rest are hits. `/dd/play/node` caches its whole response keyed on
//! the node prefix ([`node_key`]) so a re-click is a hit. One `CutoffCache` +
//! `PatternCache` pair per request is safe and hot because trump is fixed for the
//! deal (never share a `PatternCache` across trumps — see `dd.rs::solve_ddtricks`).
