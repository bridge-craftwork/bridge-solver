//! Par-score calculation from a double-dummy trick table.
//!
//! Given the max DD tricks for each seat in each strain plus vulnerability,
//! computes the contract-neutral par (the score optimal competitive bidding
//! yields, both sides free to bid). No extra solving — it is a bounded search
//! over the 35 possible contracts using duplicate scoring.
//!
//! Validated to 100% agreement with Bridge Composer's `OptimumScore` across 104
//! tournament boards (see `tests`). The `OptimumScore` convention is matched:
//! the score is labeled by the par contract's declaring side and signed to that
//! side (a sacrifice reads negative, e.g. "NS -100").
//!
//! `ParContract` is not the same tag written differently, and agreeing on the
//! score does not imply agreeing on the contract. Bridge Composer lists *every*
//! contract tied at par, separated by `"; "`, and names a single **seat** when
//! only one partner can take the tricks double-dummy — `N 3N=` where North
//! makes nine at notrump and South only eight. Both rules were read off
//! `fixtures/bridge-composer`, where our scores matched on all eight boards and
//! four of the contracts did not.
