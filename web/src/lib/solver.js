// Client for the double-dummy engine.
//
// This is the wasm replacement for Bridge-Classroom's `utils/ddsClient.js`,
// keeping its three operations and their exact request and response shapes so
// the same components and decoding code work against either. What changes is
// that there is no `fetch` and no `SOLVER_URL`: the engine is compiled into the
// page, which is what lets the site claim nothing is uploaded and back it with
// `connect-src 'self'`.
//
// The classroom client's other discipline is kept too: every call resolves to
// `null` on any failure rather than throwing. Double-dummy here is an overlay
// on a hand you can already read, so a failed solve should cost you the
// annotation and nothing else.
