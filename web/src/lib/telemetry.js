// The telemetry beacon.
//
// One record when the page loads and one when a solve finishes, so the question
// "is anyone using this, and how slow is it on real hardware" has an answer.
// Everything here is shaped by one constraint, which is ADR-001:
//
//   **No identifier of any kind.** No account, no cookie, no random ID, no
//   fingerprint, no hash of the IP. Two records from the same person cannot be
//   linked together, by us or by anyone else. The consequence is that we cannot
//   count people, only events — a deliberate trade, and the reason no consent
//   banner is required.
//
// The second constraint is the load-bearing one for this site's whole claim:
// **nothing derived from the deal is ever sent.** Not the PBN or LIN text, not
// a handviewer URL, not the contract, not the double-dummy result, not a hash
// of any of them. The payload below is an explicit allowlist for exactly that
// reason — a spread of caller-supplied fields would make it one careless call
// site away from leaking a hand.
//
// Deliberately absent for the same reason: `deviceMemory`, `hardwareConcurrency`,
// screen dimensions, language, and the full user-agent string. The first two are
// the strongest passive fingerprinting signals the page has access to; they are
// read locally to size a worker pool and never transmitted. The server derives a
// coarse browser/OS family from the UA header it already receives.
