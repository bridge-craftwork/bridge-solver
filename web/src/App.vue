 * Double-dummy analysis of a hand, in the browser.
 *
 * The shape of the page follows Bridge-Classroom's review view: the four hands
 * in a compass with the DD table and auction beside them, errors tagged on the
 * cards themselves, and clicking a card rewinding the table to that moment to
 * show what every legal card was worth.
 *
 * Two differences, both forced by this being a review page rather than a live
 * table. There is no bot and no turn-taking, so the hands show the deal as dealt
 * with the error overlay on top rather than a hand being played out. And the
 * play trace is listed trick by trick as well as tagged on the cards, because
 * the question here is where a hand went wrong, which is answered by scanning
 * tricks rather than hunting badges across four holdings.

      The "this device will take a while" warning used to appear here, and is
      withheld while its prediction is being recalibrated.

      It was wrong every time it fired, and always in the same direction: the
      published statistics put it at 5.7x over on the largest bucket of real
      measurements and 7.7x on the next, telling people to expect a couple of
      seconds where they waited three tenths of one. A warning that reliably
      overstates the wait is worse than silence — it makes a fast device look
      slow and teaches the reader to disregard the page.

      The probe still runs and its score is still reported, so the data needed to
      fix it keeps accumulating and `/stats` keeps grading the prediction against
      what actually happened. Restore this when that panel says the estimate is
      worth showing. See web/src/lib/benchmark.js for why it is wrong.

/*
 * The table with its corners measures 665px and the trace column 350px. With the
 * 22px gap and the page's own 2x18px padding that needs 1073px, so the pair only
 * genuinely fits from there — the old 1060px was about thirteen pixels short, and
 * in that sliver the compass overflowed its column and lost its edges the same
 * unscrollable way described above. Rounded up to 1080 for a little slack.
 *
 * Not raised further: the previous 1240px breakpoint collapsed the columns on an
 * iPad in landscape (1180px), which is the one case the corner layout exists
 * for, and that pushed the trace below the fold and made the page over two
 * screens tall.
