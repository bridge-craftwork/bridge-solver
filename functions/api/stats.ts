// The public performance dashboard's data.
//
// Served at `/api/stats`, deliberately *not* `/stats` — that route belongs to
// the static page a reader actually visits, and a Function mounted there would
// shadow it.
//
// ## Why this queries Analytics Engine directly
//
// The plan called for a separate cron Worker to aggregate once a day and drop a
// blob in KV. That was dropped, and the reasoning is worth keeping. Its stated
// justification was that the AE SQL API needs a token which must never reach a
// browser — true, but this Function is already server-side, so the token can
// live here just as safely. The other two justifications (cheap, spike-immune)
// are cache arguments, and a cache does not need a clock: serving the KV blob
// and refreshing it past a TTL gets the same properties, runs *no* queries on a
// day nobody visits, and is self-healing where a dead cron silently serves
// stale numbers forever. It is also one deploy artifact instead of two, since
// Pages Functions cannot carry cron triggers and a cron would have meant a
// whole second Worker.
//
// The one thing a daily job would buy that this does not is history outliving
// Analytics Engine's three-month retention. Everything below sits inside that
// window, so every figure here is recomputable on demand and the KV blob is a
// pure cache with no independent value. If a record longer than three months is
// ever wanted, that is the change to make, and it has to be made *before* the
// data ages out rather than after.
//
// Publishing these numbers openly is also the strongest available backing for
// the privacy claim: anyone can see exactly what is collected, because all of
// it is on the screen.
